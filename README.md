**Program Statement:**

A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is.

If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the program should display “The given number is too high, Try Again.” 

If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the program should display “The given number is too low, Try Again..”

The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses the random number. 

This program generates a game report by reading the text from the "FormatOfGameReport.txt" file and also print the guessed number in the report as "Number which you guessed: " here_number."
